## Lists and Tuples
### Sequence: an ordered collection (list, tuple).
### Element: an item inside a list and a tuple
### Index: zero-based position in a sequence.
### Mutability: whether an object can be changed after creation.

## List:
### List: mutable sequence (you can change items).
### Pros: data may require edits, such as an employees list

## Tuple:
### Tuple: immutable sequence—fixed length & values after creation.
### Pros: faster, safer against accidental edits; some APIs require tuples.
### Tuples can contain mutable objects—the tuple binding is fixed, but the inner object can still mutate
